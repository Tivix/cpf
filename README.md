### Folder structure

- `app`- The App Router by Next.js.
- `components` - Contains all components used in the app.
   - `common` - In the common folder, we keep all essential components like Button, Card, or Input.
   - `modules` - Here we keep more complex components that are still reusable or are part of layouts.
   - `views` - Here we compose view together to create a page. If you want to extract some module of the page, create `modules` folder there and put it in it.

- `static`- Contains assets like icons.
- `types` - Contains all reusable types and interfaces that are shared between many pages and modules.
- `utils` - Contains all utility functions like data transformations or calculations.
