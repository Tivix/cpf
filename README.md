## Cloning and Initializing the Repository with Submodules

When you clone a repository that includes submodules, you need to ensure that the submodules are initialized and updated to the correct versions. This guide will walk you through the steps to properly clone and initialize a repository with submodules.

### Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository along with its submodules, use the `--recurse-submodules` flag. This ensures that all submodules are cloned and initialized automatically.

Step 1:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:Tivix/cpf.git
```

Step 2:
```
cd cpf
```

### Initializing Submodules in an Already Cloned Repository

If the repository has already been cloned without the --recurse-submodules flag, you can manually initialize and update the submodules using the following commands:

#### 1. Initialize the Submodule
```
git submodule init
```

#### 2. Update the Submodule
```
git submodule update
```

# Installation

Instructions on how to install and set up the project.

#### Copy variables to `.env` files.
   ```
   cp .envexample .env
   ```

for testing purposes you might want to change flag `USE_MOCK_USER` to `True`

#### Build and run the project
   ```
   docker compose build
   docker compose up
   ```
   or just
   ```
   docker compose up --build
   ```

After you have done the above steps, you should be able to access the application.
