# Overview

This service helps in E2E testing of the web application.

## Before you start

- Run the app locally from the root directory.
- To run all tests in headless mode use `yarn test`.
- To debug tests use `yarn test:debug` UI mode.

## Coding practices

We use a mix of [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) within our project to help enforce consistent coding practices.
